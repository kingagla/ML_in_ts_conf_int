# ML_in_ts_conf_int
This in continuation of project https://github.com/kingagla/ML_in_time_series where I showed that using Machine Learning Models in Time Series prediction can be good idea and how to do it. 

Obviously, creating confidence intervals for Machine Learning model in TS is at least a bit challenging. That's why I'd like to present Confidence Intervals for ML models in TS inspired by ARIMA confidence intervals.
